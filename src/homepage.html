          <h2>High School</h2>
          <p>I started my journey with coding in high school, where I was lucky to have a teacher
            who saw potential in my curiosity and enthusiasm. Their encouragement led me to delve 
            deeper into computer science. Coding challenges became puzzles that I was eager to 
            solve, and I found joy in creating functional, efficient solutions. My teacher's 
            inspiring words always echoed in my mind, motivating me to never stop learning and experimenting.</p>

          <h2>University Applications</h2>
          <p>"As I neared the end of my high school years, I was faced with the choice of my future path. 
            I applied to study Computer Engineering in University, driven by the dream of 
            becoming a software engineer. It was a field that promised endless opportunities for 
            learning and innovation, two aspects that I cherished deeply."</p>

          <h2>The Current Stage</h2>
          <p>However, life took an exciting turn, and I found myself accepting 
            an apprenticeship at a prestigious company called Leonardo. Opting 
            for an apprenticeship over traditional university education allowed me
            to immerse myself in the practical aspects of the field. It offered me an 
            invaluable opportunity to learn from seasoned professionals and gain 
            hands-on experience. This blend of learning and doing has been instrumental in 
            shaping me into the engineer I am today.</p>
